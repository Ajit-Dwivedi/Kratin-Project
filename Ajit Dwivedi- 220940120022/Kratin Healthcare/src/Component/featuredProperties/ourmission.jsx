                <p>Our principal goal since the inception of Kratin in 2012 has been to provide the most 
                    advanced healthcare facility in the capital and throughout India. When Irene hospitals 
                    first opened their doors in 2012, a gap existed between the primary healthcare system and 
                    Indiaâ€™s specialized secondary health care system. Our mission is to provide the greatest
                     quality of patient care while also bridging the gap between primary and secondary health care.
                    The foremost objective of the Kratin hospital is to provide patients with comfortable treatment and quick recovery. 
                    We aim to improve healthcare by implementing a robust Action Plan and providing a complete treatment facility.
